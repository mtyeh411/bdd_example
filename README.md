Description
===========

This project was used in a live-coding demonstration of behavior-driven development in Rails using RSpec, FactoryGirls, Capybara, Shoulda, Spork, and Guard in a Mac OSX development environment.

Use Guard in development with the command:
	$ guard
or
	$ bundle exec guard

Note: if you would like to run in a non-OSX environment, you may need to remove the gem requirement for rb-fsevent in the Gemfile.
